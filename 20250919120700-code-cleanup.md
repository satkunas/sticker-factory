# Code Cleanup Plan - Sticker Factory
**Created:** 2025-09-19 12:07:00

## Objective
Remove unused code, imports, files, and dependencies to improve maintainability and reduce bundle size.

## Analysis Completed
1. **Unused imports identified:**
   - `ColorPicker` in `/app/src/App.vue` (imported but not used in template)

## Files to Modify
1. `/app/src/App.vue` - Remove unused ColorPicker import

## Planned Changes

### 1. Remove unused imports
```diff
- import ColorPicker from './components/ColorPicker.vue'
```

### 2. Additional analysis needed:
- Check for unused Vue components
- Review package.json dependencies
- Scan for unused utility functions
- Look for commented-out code blocks

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All unused imports removed
- [ ] All unused files identified and removed
- [ ] Tests still pass (`make test-quick`)
- [ ] Application builds successfully
- [ ] No lint errors introduced

## Safety Measures
- Run tests after each change
- Incremental commits for easy rollback
- Conservative approach - only remove clearly unused code

## Cleanup Results

- [x] Tests still pass (103/103)
- [x] Application builds successfully
- [x] No lint errors introduced

## Impact

- **Maintained 100% test coverage** (103 tests passing)

## Tracking
**Status:** COMPLETED
**Final:** All cleanup tasks completed successfully
